                    <p>In this article, we’ll cover how technology has impacted senior’s lives in and out of the home. Technology’s advancements have provided quicker ways to communicate through instant messaging apps and social media platforms.

                    <p>When it comes to the way we communicate overall, modern technology has had a powerful influence.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Digital technology has changed what people term as “media.” The influence of new technology on media is apparent since a media company isn’t necessarily a news platform anymore.
